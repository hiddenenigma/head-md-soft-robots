An AR experience to reflect ancestor worship. A spirit is created out of symbolism and floats above a digital altar. The location is in front of a Chinatown Kite shop located in San Francisco, the location playing an important part, not because of its in Chinatown but Kites as a way to signfiy the airiness and communication between worlds.

"Same as religion, it's not just about the action of burning offerings. It's about appreciating in your heart the culture and heritage."

## Paper References - Student Work at ECAL 

During our Training to Research module at ECAL, there were a few student projects on display that were relevant to my project.

## Paper Explorations
Continue wokring with paper and create more organic forms.

### Translucent Paper - Wavey Forms to Communicate Smoke

### Squiggles as Outlines of Smoke
Pushing limits of the Zund cutter. Note: don't pack complex curves since the paper will lift up. Didn't test but using heavier paper might help with this.

## Storyboard

Feedback from Douglas & Alexia
- Put box first since it was a bit confusing to understand the variation and ribbon. 
- Ribbon seems important, do a close up to highlight it better.
- Add squiggles to device to joss bowl interaction.
- Condense and get to the point
- Make interaction clearer
- Have sentiments instead that communicates through the incense/bowl
