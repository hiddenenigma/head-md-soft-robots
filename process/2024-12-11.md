3D printing fail but tiny win for getting the poles to go through the holes of the fan case

Need a good amount of space below, seems like 80mm to have good air intake. In addition, need to direct the air. Can potentially create a tunnel and maybe add a venturi opening. Venturi effect squeezes air more compactly when coming in which creates a higher air pressure.
