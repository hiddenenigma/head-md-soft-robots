# Week of Wood Working

Coming back from the holiday break, I started to produce my object in wood.

## Preparation

Talk to technicians on how to make object. Check out wood materials. Learn how to use lathe.

Went with pear wood since it naturally has a smooth texture to it, which helps with creating a soft feeling.

## Day 1

Determine which grain you want the wood to be. I went with vertical to have a more even look on the outside but to highlight the verticalness of the incense and smoke. 

Cut down large piece of wood into a smaller piece. Working around 160 x 160 x 150. 

Cut down again into smaller pieces that are slightly larger than 160 x 160 since material will be lost through production.

Shape the wood into even surface.

Glue the pieces together and use clamps to hold them in place. Leave over night.

## Day 2

Remove excess glue on surface. Don't worry if the glue is look ugly on the outside since it will be removed through sanding.

Mark center of wood on both ends. Make sure the grain of wood is vertical. 

Make a circle on just one end. Use a compass. Make sure rhe circle is as close to the edge as possible.

Cut corner of the wood to make an octagon. This saves time when shaping the wood to a cylinder on the lathe.

Place wood block on lathe and make into a cylinder.

Wear a mask throughout to avoid inhaing wood particles.

Measure the radius of the tool that will hold one end for when carving out the inside.

Make the holder (circle) on one end.

Carve the curve on the bottom of the vessel. Measure where the top of the curve starts from 3d Print or refer to fusion model. Kept on making my curve too small.

Increase the rotation speed by adjusting bands to speed up the process. But going faster means small movements of carving tools will leave a bigger impression and it can also be dangerous. Don't go beyond the third setting. Start slow and then increase as needed.

## Day 3

Remove from lathe and attach holding device. 

Marking the inner edge so you know where to stop carving.

Dig away.

Put on headphones to protect ears. Was screeching too much.

But actually, it was screeching because the tool was dull. Need to sharpen tool. Sharpened three times.

## Day 4

Mark the holes on the bottom for the legs. Use the stopper figufe out where holes go. The lathe rotates around 24 increments. Where the band is, there's the numbers.

Measure multiple times to make sure things are correct.

Carve out a bit more since the wall was still a bit thick. My concern was the eletronics not fitting inside. 

![](images/wood_lip.jpg)

Carve the lid lip with square tool. Mark with pencil for circle and the depth.

Drill holes for legs. Use the machine that presses directly down. Find drill bit that matches size. Note for future self and anyone else: work with standard sizes so you can use the appropriate drill bits.

Cut block of wood, 18 x 18 x 22.5. Note: should have gone longer because one end will have to be cut. Leg diameter is 15 but go a bit bigger because of material will be lost when carving.

Cut extra pieces, because you will need it. Working on small makes it harder to be precise.

Carve on lathe. Tip: get down to about 15.75 and then sand the rest. Sand from small number to large.

## Day 5

Carve last leg.

Cut off one end. Cut enough so that the leg looks even through out. I did not, and had to sand a bit.

Drill top holes for incense. First drill 15mm hole into block of wood and then 8mm in the same spot. This will be the guide. On a table, clamp leg down. Place wood block on leg and drill hole using the 8mm drill bit with a drill.  


## Things I would do differently next time:

Dig deeper. There's still a lot more depth. Not sure how this will affect the fan but will need to test

Cut extra pieces for legs and be patient. I rushed towards the end of day 4 because I wanted to get it done.

Start earlier. Go to woodshop sooner to discuss since I could have prepared the woodblock in advance. I did try before the break but it required Alex to cut down a large slab wood and he wasn't available.
