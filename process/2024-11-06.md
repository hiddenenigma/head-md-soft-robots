## Feedback
- Things are looking a bit neat, what about incorporating mess since grieving isn't so neatly packaged.
- Fuzzy Frame as a name didn't communicate the idea.
- Link, heart monitor, thinking of other objects such as lockets or even our mobile phones, we have photos of loved ones. 
- Where would Link live - on the body when out, but in the home, treat it as an object similiar to your keys. It's an essential item that you'll always take with you, so wherever you keep your keys like the entrance.
- Messy as in novel and quirky interactions. The prototypes are feeling like "Apple". My interpretation of this feedback, perhaps look back into the scroll wheel and fire and smoke. For example, what if you pull the external heart out, to light it with fire as if it's an incense, to then connect to the frame in the home. Could the External Eternal Heart emit smoke as well as light?
