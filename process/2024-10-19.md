# Notes on Technology

Attended a [talk at Mesh Festival](https://meshfestival.ch/events/nelly-y-pinkrah/en) where Nelly Y Pinkrah offered different definitions and functions of technology. Some that resonated with me were:

- Active interface with the human world
- Exposes man dealing with nature
- Tech not just as a way for progress but a lens for social relationships 
- Technology as being humane

Keywords:
- Up-rooted
- Whispering
