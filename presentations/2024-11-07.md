## Research Question
What new relationships can we have with traditional altars?

## Research
I focused my research methods on gathering online commentary to gain insights into the broader collective perspective. From there, I shifted to a more personal approach, conducting interviews and collecting drawings and photos from my network of family and friends. This allowed me to deepen my understanding through both wider societal views and intimate, firsthand experiences.

## Insights
People's adaptaption of altars and departure from traditions to meet their needs in western context and on individual/family basis. For example:
- Reflective protective materials on ceiling and walls
- Name on a piece of paper instead a photo
- Simple picture frame with print out stickers
- Fake flowers or electric candle lights
- Altar for family dog
